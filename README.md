# Biodiversity offsets and neutral theory

The following repository contains R code for a ecological simulation of biodiversity offsets using neutral theory.

Please note that this code only contains the backbone algorithms for the neutral simulation, and has been shortened for illustrative purposes (i.e. the time series is shorter, there are fewer iterations, and the code only simulates the outputs for one combination of parameters). 

Running this code will take approximately 3-5 minutes of computation time depending on your machine. There is a reporter that counts the number of iterations (Note: this counter does not report the duration of the time-series).

The complete simulation as presented in the manuscript took several hours and was run on several cloud-based RStudio servers using Amazon Web Services.
